# Getting Started

This documentation will help you getting started quickly with changing the badge code.

## Prerequisits

You will need the following things to get started

1. A laptop
* To write code, we recommend having a laptop
* If you happen to have none, we are also able to provide you a loaner, just ask us at the booth
2. An Android phone
* While not strictly required, a phone is great to build the Android app for, and our prefered way to interact with the badge
* There might be other ways, but it is up to you to find them
3. A loaner badge
* We are providing 5 badges, tied and locked to our area.
* You can use one of them, unless they are already occupied.
* Once you got the badge, we'll prepare your own one and afterwards clean the loaner up.
4. Some time to hack
* We know the conference is packed, so we tried to make it as easy as possible for you to get started
* Sadly you still would need to invest some time to get to know the app, the respository and find out what you want to do

## Goals

Your goal will be to get a badge for your selve, by building "something" on the loaner badge. Once you have build it, we make sure to merge it so that you can also execute it on your own badge. There are no limits, feel free to iterate with us at the booth, or go wild on your own.

# First Steps

You have all the prerequisits, and you know what you want to do. Great, so please clone this repository, and explore the code.

Feel free to checkout the [filename missing](./zeapp/app/src/main/missing.kt) entry point to read on how to add your own or update existing apps.

If you want to explore the python side of things, the code running on the badge is saved under `code.py`, once you connect the badge to your computer or Android. You will get extra points[^1] if you find a way to change the code running on the badge from android directly.
The file under [zeapp/zebadge/code.py](zeapp/zebadge/code.py) is the most up to date variant and should be used as an example.


[^1]: Points do nothing and are only mentioned here for a joke.

# Next Steps

Do what feels right for you, add what is missing, update something that is not quite right. There are no wrong things, unless they are destroying work from outhers.
